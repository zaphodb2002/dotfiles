I have had a number of technical issues while managing things through [[TaskWarrior]] and [[SyncThing]]. [[TaskWarrior]] switched to their new backend, [[TaskChampion]], and it's not working great.  The migration went very poorly, and it is no faster than it was before.  In general, the performance of [[TaskWarrior]] is terrible.  Completing a single [[task]] can take many seconds, and things like creating recurring tasks for the day can take upwards of 5 minutes.  It's totally single-threaded to ensure atomicity (not a good way to do this) and this means performance will NEVER improve enough.  Possibly the SQLite backend can resolve this but it's definitely not doing that now.\n\t- For now we're going to move back to [[Logseq]] and try to give that a go again, see how quickly it breaks down.  The re-inclusion of the [[Daily Notes]] is nice though, I've been meaning to implement that again in [[TaskMaster]].  [[TaskMaster]] is ultimately where we want these things to live but it's not ready for production use yet.\n- I also am interested in restructuring the hierarchy again.  Or, rather, abolishing it, lol.  We can move to a tag and link structure, so tasks and pages can be included in multiple [[Campaign]]s.  At the project level, we may need some nesting but we can do that with linking.  Basically, the idea would look something like this:\n\t- A single [[Task]] is the atomic unit\n\t\t- Subtypes of [[Task]]s\n\t\t\t- [[Goal]]s\n\t\t\t- [[Action]]s\n\t- A [[Procedure]] is a series of [[Task]]s that depend on each other\n\t\t- Subtypes of [[Procedure]]\n\t\t\t- [[Single Task Procedure]] (just a container for a single task)\n\t\t\t- [[Cumulative Procedure]] (counting steps, working for a period of time)\n\t\t\t- [[Process Procedure]] (order matters, like doing laundry then putting the clothes away)\n\t- A [[Routine]] is a set of [[Procedure]]s that are related, but do not necessarily depend on each other.  These can be recurring or scheduled on demand.\n\t- A [[Project]] is a set of [[Procedure]]s and/or [[Routine]]s that work together toward a [[Goal]].\n\t- [[Aspect]]s and [[Campaign]]s may need some rework.  [[Campaign]]s probably need to continue as the overarching life goals I hope to attain.  [[Aspect]]s, though, can muddy the water.  You go from 10 [[Campaign]]s to 100 [[Aspect]]s and that's not in the spirit of limiting information that the [[LMS]] is meant to do.  Honestly it may be best to just allow things to naturally develop as I tag things.\n\t- [[Tag]]s are what brings them all together.  An arbitrary number of tags can be applied to Tasks, and they describe it.  Based on these tags, we will assess things like urgency, difficulty, time estimates, etc.\n- Today it would be nice to maybe set up some goals and restructure the daily tasks.  Right now the TaskWarrior dailies are out of control.  Because automatic dependency for recurring tasks isn't possible, everything is a mess.  Further, the [[Scheduled Date]] and [[Until Date]] don't work either, so everything must be scheduled or failed manually.  This is a major pain point.  More automation is a must.\n\t- I've spent some time fleshing out some new campaigns and what I've been doing is just outlining what the overall goals of campaigns should be.  Big pie-in-the-sky stuff.  Then we can make projects based on those.  No more thinking about what I have to do, let's start with figuring out what I want to accomplish in my life and go from there.\n- Spent some time messing with a terminal Spotify client.  Why am I like this?\n\t- Ended up not even using it\n- I am actively #procrastinating the job hunt and [[AJLMF]] stuff.  I need to go do that now.\n\t- Sent those emails at least.  Hopefully Cloudron works correctly but I assume it will.  Haven't really had an issue yet.\n\t- I did apply for jobs.  There are not a lot of great options in my space right now.  Everything is tech support for pennies or ironmongers.  I am not a fan.  I did apply for a couple of interesting ones though, we'll see.  Gotta keep that up.\n- Need to implement some
