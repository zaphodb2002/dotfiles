# LibAboutPanel-2.0
An embedded library that scans your AddOn's ToC to display that information either as a seperate __About__ button in the Interface Options panel, or as part of AceConfig-3.0 options table.

## Getting LAP into your own addon
Step one is to add LibAboutPanel-2.0 to your addon's .pkgmeta file. Assuming you have a folder named Libs into which you are adding all your libs, the .pkgmeta section would look like the following:

`externals:
  Libs/LibAboutPanel-2.0: https://github.com/Myrroddin/libaboutpanel-2.0`

Step two is in your ToC file, with either of the above methods, load the .xml file that loads LibAboutPanel-2.0:

`Libs\LibAboutPanel-2.0\lib.xml`

The final step is embedding LibAboutPanel-2.0 into your addon to use its APIs. Embedding LAP is optional yet recommended.

```lua
-- using Ace3
local MyAddon = LibStub("AceAddon-3.0"):NewAddon("MyAddon", "LibAboutPanel-2.0")

-- not using Ace3
local folderName, MyAddon = ...
LibStub("LibAboutPanel-2.0"):Embed(MyAddon)

-- now you can use the APIs
function MyAddon:DoSomething()
    -- self refers to MyAddon
    self:CreateAboutPanel() -- not strictly accurate, see docs
end

-- not embedding LAP
local folderName, MyAddon = ...
local LAP = LibStub("LibAboutPanel-2.0")

function MyAddon:DoSomething()
    LAP:CreateAboutPanel() -- not strictly accurate, see docs
end
```

Please be aware that capitalization in the .pkgmeta and .toc files matters, and the different slashes ("/" in .pkgmeta and "\\" in .toc files). These conventions are standards set by others. Like any other WoW addon or library, LibAboutPanel-2.0 must follow the standards.

## Retail, Wrath, or Classic
LibAboutPanel-2.0 should work in all versions of the game.

## Not a drop-in replacement
LibAboutPanel and LibAboutPanel-2.0 do more or less the same thing, but LAP2 will not replace Ackis' version just because you have it installed. As an author, you can make the choice which you prefer.

## API
You can find the [API here](https://www.wowace.com/addons/libaboutpanel-2-0/pages/api/) on this page, and the [examples here](https://www.wowace.com/projects/libaboutpanel-2-0/pages/example)

## Features that are new or different than Ackis' LibAboutPanel
* More localization. LAP2 uses global strings to translate factions, locale names, etc. It also has more translatable strings than the original.
* Its API is embedded, so __MyAddOn:API()__ is the norm.
* LAP2 has an API that supports AceConfig-3.0 options tables, thus the About panel can be displayed as a tab, part of a tree, etc.
